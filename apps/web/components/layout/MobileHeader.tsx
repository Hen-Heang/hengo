 * Contextual mobile header. Root pages get a title plus a full row of

 * affordances, rendered directly rather than folded into a "⋯" menu. The menu
 * held exactly Search and Settings, and on a settings sub-page one of the two
 * was a no-op ("Settings", from inside Settings); one tap to reach either is
 * strictly better than two everywhere else. Profile and level stay off this
 * bar, but Settings keeps an icon on both variants — V2's bottom bar has no
 * "More" sheet to hold it anymore (see `MobileBottomNav`), so this header is
 * the only chrome that offers it.
 * V2 Phase 7: the "Quick capture" action (Inbox) was dropped from both the
 * root action row and the detail-page menu — Inbox is on the hide list, and a
 * persistent header button was the last unconditional promotion of it left in
 * the shell. `openQuickCapture()` / `QuickCaptureDialog` are untouched, still
 * reachable by searching the Quick Switcher.
