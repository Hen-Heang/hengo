 * The card's whole value proposition is showing your real calendar beside
 * Hengo tasks — but Tasks and Calendar live in the Plan section, and V2's
 * five-item nav has no entry for it (see `primaryNavItems` in
 * lib/navigation.ts). Asking for third-party calendar access to populate a
 * page with no front door is a bad trade, so the section is hidden rather
 * than removed. Turn this on in the same release that gives Plan a nav entry.
 *
 * Hiding never strands an existing connection: the page still renders for a
 * learner who is already connected, so "Disconnect" is always reachable.
